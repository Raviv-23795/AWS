**What is S3?**

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere and at any time on the Internet. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. It offers an extremely durable, highly available, and infinitely scalable data storage infrastructure at very low costs.

Amazon S3 stores data as objects within buckets. An object consists of a file and to store an object in Amazon S3, you upload the file you want to store to a bucket. When you upload a file, you can set permissions on the object. Buckets are the containers for objects. You can have one or more buckets. For each bucket, you can control access to it (who can create, delete, and list objects in the bucket).

**Advantages of using Amazon S3:**

Following are some of the advantages of using Amazon S3:

1. Creating buckets – Create and name a bucket that stores data. Buckets are the fundamental containers in Amazon S3 for data storage.
2. Storing data – Store an infinite amount of data in a bucket. Upload as many objects as you like into an Amazon S3 bucket. Each object can contain up to 5 TB of data. Each object is stored and retrieved using a unique developer-assigned key.
3. Downloading data – Download your data or enable others to do so. Download your data anytime you like, or allow others to do the same.
4. Permissions – Grant or deny access to others who want to upload or download data into your Amazon S3 bucket.
5. Standard interfaces – Use standards-based REST and SOAP interfaces designed to work with any internet-development toolkit.
